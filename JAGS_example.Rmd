# Introduction to JAGS  ("Just Another GIBBS Sampler")

[Based on one of the examples at http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2010/08/20/using-jags-in-r-with-the-rjags-package/]

First you must install jags on your computer! rjags won't run without it.
e.g., in the terminal using homebrew: brew install jags"
Then install the rjags package:
```{r}
#install.packages("rjags")
library(rjags)
library(coda)
```


# An example using normal rvs, where we are infering the mean and variance:

Let's assume we have a set of rvs that we know are normally distributed, but we wish to infer their mean and variance. Generate a test set of data:
```{r}
N <- 1000
x <- rnorm(N, 0, 2)
 
write.table(x,
            file = 'example1.data',
            row.names = FALSE,
            col.names = FALSE)
```

Now we need to write a model specification in JAGS syntax. Put the model specification (below) in a file called example1.bug. The complete model looks like this:

model {
	for (i in 1:N) {  
           x[i] ~ dnorm(mu, tau)  
    	}  
    	mu ~ dnorm(0, .0001)  
	    tau <- pow(sigma, -2)  
	    sigma ~ dunif(0, 100)  
}

* The first line says that you are specifying a model. 
* Then you set up the model for every single data point using a "for" loop. 
Here, we say that x[i] is distributed normally with mean mu and precision tau.
Note that rjags works with precision rather than variance! 
(Precision=1/variance)
* Then we specify priors for mu and tau. 
* mu is assumed to be distributed normally with mean 0 and standard deviation 100. This is an example of a  non-informative prior. (Which means that it doesn't strongly favor any particular value of mu.) 
* Then we specify tau as a deterministic function (hence the deterministic "<-" instead of the distributional "~") of sigma, after raising sigma to the -2 power. Then we say that sigma has a uniform prior over the interval [0,100].

Now we set up our model object in R:
```{r}
jags <- jags.model('example1.bug',   # specification file
                   data = list('x' = x,   # the data (must use same names as the model spec. file)
                               'N' = N),
                   n.chains = 4, # how many parallel chains to run
                   n.adapt = 100   # it will use adaptive sampling, adapting during the first 100 iterations
                   )
 
update(jags, 1000)    # run another 1000 iterations. The update function is used to add more iterations if you decide you need them. (What's nice is that you can do htis after you've looked at the first run, and it will act as if you had just continued that run.)
 
samps <- jags.samples(jags,   # draw 1000 samples from the output for the requested variables
             c('mu', 'tau'),
             1000)

summary(samps)
```


You can also set it for use of coda diagnostics for convergence (which also seems to provide a better summary of the output)
```{r}
samps2 <- coda.samples( jags, c('mu','tau'), 1000 )
summary(samps2)
plot(samps2)
show(gelman.diag(samps2))
```
